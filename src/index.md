I’m a graphic designer with a focus on research-driven websites and data visualization. Since 2015 I’ve worked as a lead designer at [Upstatement](https://upstatement.com) in Boston. Here are a few favorite projects I’ve helped design and build:

- [PBS NewsHour Election Graphics](http://upstatement.com/work/pbs-newshour/) ↝ Automated [results tables](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/elections-2020/massachusetts), a [calendar](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/elections-2020/calendar), [delegate tracker](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/elections-2020/delegate-tracker) and [winner-called graphics](https://twitter.com/NewsHour/status/1235050355022368768) for web, social, and broadcast.
- [The Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette) ↝ A new design for Harvard’s official voice.
- [Yale Environment 360](https://e360.yale.edu/) ↝ Independent science reporting in a classical package.
- [Everytown Gun Law Navigator](https://everytownresearch.org/navigator/)  ↝ Explore and compare 25 years of state gun law data.


And a few personal projects:
