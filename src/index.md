I’m a graphic designer with a focus on research-driven websites and data visualization. Since 2015 I’ve worked as a lead designer at [Upstatement](https://upstatement.com) in Boston. Here are a few favorite projects I’ve helped design and build:

- [The 19th*](https://19thnews.org) ↝ A nonpartisan newsroom reporting on gender, politics and policy.
- [PBS NewsHour Election Graphics](http://upstatement.com/work/pbs-newshour/) ↝ An API-powered web app that generates real-time [results tables](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/elections-2020/massachusetts), a race-by-race [calendar](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/elections-2020/calendar), a [delegate tracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkAJnUos97g&feature=youtu.be&t=1347) and [winner-called graphics](https://twitter.com/NewsHour/status/1235050355022368768) for web, social, and broadcast.
- [The Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette) ↝ A new design for Harvard’s official voice.
- [Yale Environment 360](https://e360.yale.edu/) ↝ Independent science reporting in a classical package.
