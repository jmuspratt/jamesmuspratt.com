I’m a graphic designer with a focus on research-driven websites and data visualization. Since 2015 I’ve worked as a lead designer at [Upstatement](https://upstatement.com) in Boston. Here are a few favorite projects I’ve been a part of:

- [The Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette)  
A new design for Harvard’s official voice.
- [Yale Environment 360](https://e360.yale.edu/)  
Independent science reporting in a classical package.
- [Everytown Gun Law Navigator](https://everytownresearch.org/navigator/)  
Explore and compare 25 years of state gun law data.


And a few personal projects:

-  [Memory](https://memory.jamesmuspratt.com/)  
The classic card-matching game, built as a progressive web app for tablets. In progress.

- [Money and Jobs](https://money.jamesmuspratt.com/)
